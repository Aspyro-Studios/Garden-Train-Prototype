# Garden Train

A video game prototype where a train conductor transports garden inhabitants to their destinations hopefully without a hitch.

This video game is both a prototype and a demonstration of my skills as a Game Developper and Game Designer.

## Concept

You play as a tiny train conductor working in a group of interconnected gardens. The inhabitants of those gardens need you to move faster to their destination.
But be careful, your train is no ordinary train : there is no rails to ride on ! You will need to make your own path through the gardens, taking note of where you need to go but also of the events that may or may not happen while you travel.
And of course, you must not be late or the inhabitants will request for refund of their ticket.
